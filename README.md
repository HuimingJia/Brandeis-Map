##how to run the code in terminal
###run part1
```
java -jar current_directory/out/artifacts/PA4_jar/PA4.jar route
```
### run part2
1. get pre order MST tour
```
java -jar current_directory/out/artifacts/PA4_jar/PA4.jar tour 0
```
###

2. get shortest cycle tour start from some location
```
java -jar current_directory/out/artifacts/PA4_jar/PA4.jar tour 1
```

## output
1. output sample
```
current_directory/output
```

###

1. program output path
```
current_directory/out/artifacts/PA4_jar/output
```

```
1.output.txt - text format path out put
2.Route.txt - coordinate for printing route on original map
3.RouteCropped.text - coordinate for printing route on cropped map
